# Thread Pool & ExecutorService

### Why ThreadPool
A thread pool helps mitigate the issue of performance by reducing the number of threads needed and managing their lifecycle.

Essentially, threads are kept in the thread pool until theyâ€™re needed, after which they execute the task and return the pool to be reused later. 

# Implementation :
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
 
class Task implements Runnable {
    private String name;
 
    public Task(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
 
    public void run() {
        try {
            Long duration = (long) (Math.random() * 1000);
            System.out.println("Executing : " + name);
            Thread.sleep(duration);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class Main 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
         
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) 
        {
            Task task = new Task("Task " + i);
            System.out.println("Created : " + task.getName());
 
            executor.execute(task);
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}


```

## Output :
```
Created : Task 1
Created : Task 2
Created : Task 3
Created : Task 4
Created : Task 5
Created : Task 6
Created : Task 7
Created : Task 8
Created : Task 9
Created : Task 10
Executing : Task 4
Executing : Task 3
Executing : Task 1
Executing : Task 2
Executing : Task 5
Executing : Task 6
Executing : Task 7
Executing : Task 8
Executing : Task 9
Executing : Task 10
```
